# Git Tasks

These `Tasks` are Git tasks to work with repositories used by other tasks
in your Pipeline.

## `git-clone`

**Please Note: this Task is only compatible with Tekton Pipelines versions 0.11-rc1 and greater!**

This `Task` has two required inputs:

1. The URL of a git repo to clone provided with the `url` param.
2. A Workspace called `output`.

The `git-clone` `Task` will clone a repo from the provided `url` into the
`output` Workspace. By default the repo will be cloned into the root of
your Workspace. You can clone into a subdirectory by setting this `Task`'s
`subdirectory` param.

This `Task` does the job of the legacy `GitResource` `PipelineResource` and
is intended as its replacement. This is part of our plan to [offer replacement
`Tasks` for Pipeline Resources](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/issues/95)
as well as
[document those replacements](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1369).

### Workspaces

* **output**: A workspace for this Task to fetch the git repository in to.

### Parameters

* **url**: git url to clone (_required_)
* **revision**: git revision to checkout (branch, tag, sha, refâ€¦) (_default:_ master)
* **refspec**: git refspec to fetch before checking out revision (_default_:refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master)
* **submodules**: defines if the resource should initialize and fetch the submodules (_default_: true)
* **depth**: performs a shallow clone where only the most recent commit(s) will be fetched (_default_: 1)
* **sslVerify**: defines if http.sslVerify should be set to true or false in the global git config (_default_: true)
* **subdirectory**: subdirectory inside the "output" workspace to clone the git repo into (_default:_ "")
* **deleteExisting**: clean out the contents of the repo's destination directory if it already exists before cloning the repo there (_default_: false)
* **httpProxy**: git HTTP proxy server for non-SSL requests
* **httpsProxy**: git HTTPS proxy server for SSL requests
* **noProxy**: git no proxy - opt out of proxying HTTP/HTTPS requests

### Results

* **commit**: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task

## Usage

### `git-clone`

This pipeline uses the git-clone Task to check out the
[`tektoncd/pipeline`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) repository
and then display that repo's README.md.

A workspace called "shared-workspace" is passed first to the `git-clone`
Task for the code to be checked out on and then to the `cat-readme` Task
to print the README.md file from.

After the Pipeline has run you'll be able to see a
[Task Result](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/taskruns.md#results)
named `commit` in the PipelineRun's Status with the commit SHA that was
fetched by the `git-clone` Task.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: cat-readme
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    mountPath: /source
  params:
  - name: subdirectory
    description: Subdirectory inside "source" workspace that contains the README.md.
    default: "."
  steps:
  - name: cat-readme
    image: ubuntu
    script: cat "$(workspaces.source.path)/$(params.subdirectory)/README.md"
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: cat-pipeline-readme
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
    # description: The git repo will be cloned into this workspace and the readme will be read from it.
  tasks:
  - name: fetch-repository
    taskRef:
      name: git-clone
    workspaces:
    - name: output
      workspace: shared-workspace
    params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline.git
    - name: subdirectory
      value: pipeline-checkout
  - name: print-readme
    taskRef:
      name: cat-readme
    runAfter:
    - fetch-repository # required to ensure clone occurs before reading
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
    params:
    - name: subdirectory
      value: pipeline-checkout
```

This pipeline can be used as the following `PipelineRun` does.

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: workspace-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: cat-pipeline-readme-run
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: cat-pipeline-readme
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: workspace-pvc
```

## `git-batch-merge`

This task takes a set of refspecs, fetches them and performs git operations
(cherry-pick or merge) to apply them in order on the given base revision (default master).
The resulting commit SHA will not match across taskruns, but the git tree SHA should
match. This can be useful for batch testing changes, for example, when you want to
batch up your PRs into a single merge by taking the HEAD of the branch you want to merge
to, and adding all the PRs to it. This concept is used in tools such as [Tide][tide] to
batch test PR's, and [Zuul CI Gating][zuul-ci], to perform speculative execution of
PR's/change requests individually

This `Task` has four required inputs:

1. The URL of a git repo to clone provided with the `url` param.
1. A space separated string of refs `BatchedRefs` to fetch and batch over the given `revision`
1. Merge `mode` to use while batching (merge, merge-resolve, merge-squash, cherry-pick)
1. A Workspace called `output`.

There are 4 additional parameters in addition to the ones mentioned above for the git-clone task:
* **batchedRefs**: space separated git [refnames][git-ref] to fetch and batch on top of revision using the given mode
    (must be a valid refs, no commit SHA's).
* **mode**: Batch mode to select (_default_: merge) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`merge`: corresponds to git merge -s recursive. This is the default mode used by github <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`cherry-pick`: corresponds to git cherry-pick <br>
  See [git-merge][git-merge] and [git-cherry-pick][git-cherry-pick]
* **gitUserName**: git user name to use for creating the batched commit (First Last)
    (_default_: GitBatch Task). See [git-user-config][git-user-config]
* **gitUserEmail**: git user email to use for creating the batched commit (First.Last@domain.com)
  (_default_: GitBatch.Task@tekton.dev). See [git-user-config][git-user-config]

### Results

* **commit**: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task
* **tree**: The [git tree][git-tree] object SHA that was created after batch merging the refs on HEAD.
