# StackRox/Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Image Scan Task

This tasks allows you to check an image against build-time policies and apply enforcement to fail builds.  It's a companion to the stackrox-image-scan task, which returns full vulnerability scan results for an image.

## Prerequisites

This task requires an active installation of [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/advanced-cluster-security-for-kubernetes-datasheet) or [StackRox](https://www.stackrox.io/).  It also requires configuration of secrets for the Central endpoint and an API token with at least CI privileges.  `samples\rox-secrets.yaml` shows how to create the appropriate secrets.

## Install the Task

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/stackrox-image-scan/0.1/stackrox-image-scan.yaml
```

## Parameters

- **rox_central_endpoint**: Secret containing the address:port tuple for StackRox Central (example - rox.stackrox.io:443)
- **rox_api_token**: Secret containing the StackRox API token with CI permissions
- **image**: Full name of image to scan (example -- gcr.io/rox/sample:5.0-rc1)
- **insecure-skip-tls-verify**: When set to `"true"`, skip verifying the TLS certs of the Central endpoint.  Defaults to `"false"`.

## Usage

StackRox/RHACS scans images that have been pushed to a registry.  This enables scanning regardless of whether the build is using traditional Docker-based approaches, hosted/SaaS-based approaches where the Docker socket may not be directly available, or rootless approaches like `kaniko` and `buildah`.

`samples\rox-pipeline.yaml` is a sample pipeline that takes the image to scan as a parameter.  Calling the task directly looks like this:

```yaml
  tasks:
    - name: image-check
      taskRef:
        name: rox-image-check
        kind: ClusterTask
      params:
        - name: image
          value:  docker.io/stackrox/kube-linter:0.2.2
        - name: rox_api_token
          value: roxsecrets
        - name: rox_central_endpoint
          value: roxsecrets
```

If the image fails one or more enforced policies, this task will return a failure, causing the build to fail.
