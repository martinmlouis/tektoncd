# Mypy Linter for Python

`Mypy` is an optional `static type checker` for `Python` that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. `Mypy` combines the expressive power and convenience of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time type checking. `Mypy` type checks standard Python programs; run them using any Python VM with basically no runtime overhead.

The following task is used to provide static analysis on python files mounted using `mypy` (Python linter).

## Installing the Task

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/mypy-lint/0.2/mypy-lint.yaml
```

## Parameters
- **image**: The container image to use. (_Default_: `docker.io/cytopia/mypy:latest-0.4@sha256:0d5e1a97ce68c4aeececc818c8bf19301b396edbe36a6f83eca8248d7d84a05c`)
- **requirements_file**: The name of the requirements file inside the workspace that will be used by pip to install mypy. 
      If this file does not exist the task will not fail, but pip will not install anything. (_Default_: `requirements.txt`)
- **args**: The extra params along with the file path needs to be provided as the part of `args`. (_Default_: `["--help"]`)

## Workspaces

- **shared-workspace**: The workspace containing files on which we want to apply linter check. It can be a shared workspace with the `git-clone` task or a `ConfigMap` mounted containing some files.

## Platforms

The Task can be run on `linux/amd64` platform.

## Usage

1. Create the `git-clone` task

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/git-clone/0.1/git-clone.yaml
```

2. Create the PVC
3. Apply the required tasks

4. Create the Pipeline and PipelineRun for `Python` linter

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: linter-pipeline
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: shared-workspace
  tasks:
    - name: fetch-repository
      taskRef:
        name: git-clone
      workspaces:
        - name: output
          workspace: shared-workspace
      params:
        - name: url
          value: https://github.com/vinamra28/tekton-linter-test
        - name: revision
          value: "linter-test"
        - name: subdirectory
          value: ""
        - name: deleteExisting
          value: "true"
    - name: mypy-lint-run #lint python
      taskRef:
        name: mypy-lint
      runAfter:
        - fetch-repository
      workspaces:
        - name: shared-workspace
          workspace: shared-workspace
      params:
        - name: args
          value: ["python.py"]

---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: linter-pipeline-run
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: linter-pipeline
  workspaces:
    - name: shared-workspace
      persistentvolumeclaim:
        claimName: linter-pvc
```

**NOTE**: Pipeline will go into `failed` state if the linter check fails.
