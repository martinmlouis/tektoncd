# trivy-scanner

This task allows the use of the trivy vulnerlability scanner for Tekton Pipelines.See <https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy>

## What's Trivy?

Trivy (tri pronounced like trigger, vy pronounced like envy) is a simple and comprehensive scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack. Trivy is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're ready to scan

### Examples

Run `trivy --help` for Trivy usage.

Using the [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/blob/main/docs/cmd/tkn_task_start.md) (`tkn`):

```shell
tkn task start trivy-scanner -p ARGS="--help" -p IMAGE_PATH="" --workspace name=manifest-dir,emptyDir=""
```

Scan Alpine Image:

```shell
tkn task start trivy-scanner -p ARGS="image,--exit-code,0" -p IMAGE_PATH="docker.io/alpine:3.13" --workspace name=manifest-dir,emptyDir=""
```
