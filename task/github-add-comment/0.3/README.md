# Add a comment to an issue or a pull request

The `github-add-comment` task let you add a comment to a pull request or an
issue.

## Changelog

- `Optional Workspace` support is added so that if you want to pass a file
  which contains the comment then it can be passed via workspace.
  (Use Case can be after running the CI you want to output the logs as
  a part of the CI.)
- Parameter `COMMENT` has been changed to `COMMENT_OR_FILE` in which user can
  provide the filename in case comments are present inside some file or you can
  directly pass the comments as well.

## Install the Task

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/task/github-add-comment/0.3/github-add-comment.yaml
```

## Secrets

This Task requires access to a GitHub token set via a Kubernetes Secret. By default, the name of this Secret should be `github` and the secret key should be `token`, but you can configure this via the `GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME` and `GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY` [parameters](#parameters) described below.

To create such a Secret via `kubectl`:

```
kubectl create secret generic github --from-literal token="MY_TOKEN"
```

Check [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to get personal access token for `Github`.

See GitHub's documentation on [Understanding scopes for OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) to figure out what scopes you need to give to this token to add comment to an issue or a pull request.

        The cat went here and there
        And the moon spun round like a top,
        And the nearest kin of the moon,
        The creeping cat, looked up.
        Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,
        For, wander and wail as he would,
        The pure cold light in the sky
        Troubled his animal blood.
```
