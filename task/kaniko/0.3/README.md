# Kaniko

This Task builds source into a container image using Google's
[`kaniko`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kaniko) tool.

>kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command within a
>Dockerfile completely in userspace.  This enables building container images in
>environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon, such as a
>standard Kubernetes cluster.

kaniko is meant to be run as an image, `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v1.5.1`. This
makes it a perfect tool to be part of Tekton.

## Changelog

- Replace `ServiceAccount` based authentication with a workspace based one. Tekton's built-in auth
  [can be disabled](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/auth.md#disabling-tektons-built-in-auth),
  it can be hard to debug and it might not work for all type of credentials. Workspaces are available to all
  deployments, and can be bound to both secrets and PVCs.

## Install the Task

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/kaniko/0.3/kaniko.yaml
```

## Parameters

* **IMAGE**: The name (reference) of the image to build.
* **DOCKERFILE**: The path to the `Dockerfile` to execute (_default:_ `./Dockerfile`)
* **CONTEXT**: The build context used by Kaniko (_default:_ `./`)
* **EXTRA_ARGS**: Additional args to pass to the Kaniko executor.
* **BUILDER_IMAGE**: The Kaniko executor image to use (_default:_ `gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v1.5.1`)

## Workspaces

* **source**: A [Workspace](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/workspaces.md) containing the source to build.
* **dockerconfig**: An optional [Workspace](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/workspaces.md) containing a Docker `config.json`

## Results

* **IMAGE-DIGEST**: The digest of the image just built.

## Authentication to a Container Registry

kaniko builds an image and pushes it to the destination defined as a parameter.
In order to properly authenticate to the remote container registry, it needs to
have the proper credentials. This can achieved by using a workspace that contains
the docker `config.json`.

When using a workspace, the workspace shall be bound to a secret that embeds the
configuration file in a key called `config.json`.

## Platforms

The Task can be run on `linux/amd64` platform.

## Usage

This TaskRun runs the Task to fetch a Git repo, and build and push a container
image using Kaniko
